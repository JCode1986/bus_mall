User Stories
1.) As a developer, i would want 3 in the same sizes side by side for the user to pick from. All pictures should be the same size so none of them are favorable over the other.
2.) As user, i do not want to see the same picture from which I am selecting from, or any repeating pictures.
3.) As a developer, I want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. 
4.) As a developer, I will need to track how many times each image is displayed, for statistical purposes.
5.) As a developer, I want a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image.
6.) As a user, I would like to see the list of products that I have clicked on, and receive a total vote at the end.
7.) As a developer, I need a listener that will turn off after 25 selections have been made.
